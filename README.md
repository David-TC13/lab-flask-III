## Introduction

On this lab, you will continue working on the API you created on the previous lab. On this lab, you will create a connection to a MySQL database.

The goal is to have this workflow:

Browser endpoints < function defined under endpoint < function that queries < function that establishes connection

This way, we will manage to run SQL queries by just passing one word/one endpoint.

### Iteration 1

Copy the API you created. It should look like this:

```bash
your-code/
    main.ipynb
.gitignore
README.md

small-api/
    main.py
    config/
        sql_connection.py
    tools/
        sql_queries.py
```

- From your terminal, run `python main.py`
- In that terminal, you'll get feedback of your prints and the errors.
- After the server is up and running you'll be able to go into your browser and access the endpoints you defined.

### Iteration 2

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
